-First of all this is my very first real Android app. 
  Despite all the problems I am very proud of what I could achieve in a very short period of time.
  I hope you consider It when assesssing the project.

-Tested with a Xiaomi Mi A1 using a custom Android 8.1 ROM

-Third party libraries used:
  -okhttp: to make API requests and then retrieve a JSON
  -GSon: to easily parse a JSON to a list of movies objects
  -Picasso: to easily load and cache the movies images shown
